#Sunrise Project
##Introduction

The Sunrise Project is a research project, that aims to design an Open Source  hackable DLP based 3D printing system.

##Approach
The intention is to make the machine accesible to the general public. It must be sourceable, craftable, and modifiable by everyone. It aspires to be a platform for the community to explore this technology. Mechanics are scalable, source is available and modifiable, tools are open and obtainable.

##The technology

DLP 3D Printing uses photopolymierizing resin to craft the parts. Parts generate layer by layer as they are cured by a projector that outputs the cross-sections of the part, into the resin. There are various mechanical structures that can be used to achieve this.

This machine has what is called a _Bottom-Up_ structure. It has a vat, with transparent bottom, filled with resin. Underneath, an upward pointing DLP projector shoots light through the bottom window. The light striking on a **downward pointing** build surface cures the resin, forming a new layer.
Repeating this process, curing one layer below the previous one, ends up crafting the whole part, **upside down**.

##The machine


<img src="./doc/README/Sunrise02.png" width="200" align="center">


This machine tries to stick to the RepRap philosophy, so structure and moving parts are 3D printed. Motion control is performed by an Arduino with a CNCShield, running a version of [GRBL][GRBL-link] that can be found [here][Sunrise-fw].
The projector is an [Optoma ML750][Optoma-link], with hacked optics for nearer focus.
PDMS based vat and flexible bottom vat system are being considered.


##About this repo

This repo contains the mechanical structure source. The tool of use is FreeCAD.
Folder content is descripted below
* `src`: Source files and assembly.
* `Step`: Step files for CAD import.
* `stl`: stl files for 3D printing.
* `FEM`: Part file duplicates for possible FEM analysis.
* `Fonts`: Fonts used in the design of the parts.
* `doc`: useful files for documentation
* `Software`: Provisional, holds useful software until it gets big enough for it to have its own repo.

##History

###Sunrise v0.2 (in development)

<img src="./doc/README/Sunrise02.png" width="200" align="center"><img src="./doc/README/Sunrise02real.JPG" height="284" align="center">

####Specs (may be changed):

* Hacked [Optoma ML750][Optoma-link] pico-projector.
* Expandable design, able to hold several projectors.
* [Arduino UNO][AU-link] + [CNCShield][CNCS-link] + [a modified GRBL][Sunrise-fw] for motion control.
* [Creation Workshop][CW] as slicer and projector control.
