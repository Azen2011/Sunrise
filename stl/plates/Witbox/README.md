##3D Printing plates for Witbox
These plates are designed for you to print a Sunrise in less prints, using a Witbox (297x210cm). Note that these are REALLY LONG prints, and experienced handling of the 3D printer is required, specially when leveling the platform, and preventing part warping.

To clone a Sunrise this way, you need:
* 1 x [plate1.stl][first]
* 1 x [plate2.stl][second]
* 1 x [plate3.stl][third]
* 1 x [plate4.stl][fourth]
* 1 x [plate5.stl][fifth]
* 1 x [Platform.stl][platform]

[first]: ./plate1.stl
[second]: ./plate2.stl
[third]: ./plate3.stl
[fourth]: ./plate4.stl
[fifth]: ./plate5.stl
[platform]: ../../ZAxisModule/Platform.stl
