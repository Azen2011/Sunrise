##3D Printing plates for 20x20 cm plates
These plates are designed for you to print a Sunrise in less prints. Note that these are LONG prints, and experienced handling of the 3D printer is required, specially when leveling the platform, and preventing part warping.

If you print a Sunrise this way, you'll need:

[AnklesUProj]: ./AnklesAndUpperProj.stl
[TipsBeam]: ./TipsAndMainBeam.stl
[UpperNodes]: ./UpperNodes.stl
[ZAxis]: ./Zaxis.stl
[Zcarriage]: ./ZcarriageAndBarHolders.stl
